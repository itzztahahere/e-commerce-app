# Product Listing Project - Hackathon

## Overview
This project is part of a hackathon assignment where we were required to implement a UI/UX design based on a Figma template assigned to us based on the last digit of our roll number. The focus was primarily on implementing the frontend using **Next.js with App Router** and achieving a **pixel-perfect, responsive design**.

## My Details
- **Name**: Muhammad Taha Sami
- **Roll Number**: 00088802

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and learned many new things, especially around app routing, dynamic routing, and creating responsive designs. It was a great experience working on this hackathon, and I look forward to applying what I've learned in future projects.

## Project Purpose
This project simulates a product listing page, where users can:
- View all available products at the `/allproducts` route.
- Access an about page with information about the site at the `/about` route.
- Browse specific product listings at the `/productlisting` route.

The purpose of the project is to practice using **Next.js App Router** for dynamic routing and build a responsive, user-friendly interface using **Tailwind CSS** and **Custom CSS**.

## Key Components Implemented
- **App Routing**: Implemented dynamic routes in Next.js using the App Router. Key routes include:
  - `/allproducts` - Displays a list of all available products.
  - `/about` - Displays information about the website.
  - `/productlisting` - Displays detailed product listings.
  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the design is fully responsive on all screen sizes using **Tailwind CSS** and custom CSS.

- **UI/UX Implementation**: Focused on achieving a pixel-perfect design based on the provided Figma template, ensuring a consistent user experience.

- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Next.js** for routing and building the web app.
  - **Tailwind CSS** for styling and making the design responsive.
  - **Custom CSS** for additional styling as per the design requirements.
